# COVID Vaccination 

## Introduction

Hello Everyone!

We've been working on this project for 4 weeks, and is all about gathering all the vaccine data for the region. Our goal was to make sense of all the data and visualize it. The users can be anyone, maybe more towards people working in health sector. 

We had Knowit as a product owner, and they presented the project to us with all the user stories needed to get us going. We worked agile, and everything was set to be done within two sprints.

We got together and designed a prototype of the website to illustrate how it was going to look. This wasn't just a prototype, this was the blueprint of what we imagined our real website to be — a place where a lot of confusing data transforms into easy-to-understand visual graphs. 

Our vision was to present everything in different charts......
